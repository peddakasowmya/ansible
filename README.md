# ANSIBLE
- Ansible is opensource, agent less, 
- purely works based on SSH
- works with push and pull commands
- The only thing you need to do that your ANSIBLE Server should be able to SSH to the nodes that need configuration management.

### ANSIBLE can be operated in 2 ways
    - Manual way        ( No code approach and its 100% not recommended)
    - Automated way     ( YAML : playbooks )
